# REACT PORTFOLIO

## Description
* Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects. Now that you’ve completed multiple projects, my task is to create a portfolio, using your new React skills to help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
